# NetFPV

(This was written in 2013 and hasn't been touched since - migrating over from SourceForge as I want to tinker with it again)

The idea behind this project is to allow Internet control of Radio control FPV models.

The basis of this control is a video game-style joypad on the client end communicating with host running the server code which will be connected to an RC transmitter via an Arduino board. Video is captured from the models VTX via a capture card on the server and broadcast down to the client - Skype has been tested and works well.
